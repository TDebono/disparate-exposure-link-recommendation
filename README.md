# The Effect of Link Recommendation on Centrality and Groups' Visibility in Online Social Networks

This work investigates the effect of SALSA, a popular link recommendation algorithm, on network centrality and disparate exposure between two groups, a minority and a majority, in a network. Previous works have primarily used some notion of degree or ranking to identify exposure inequalities. It has been established, however, that degree only captures limited information with respect to nodal influence and importance in a network and, therefore, may not be a fully accurate measure when evaluating how link recommendations impact group exposure. Hence, we use three different metrics that capture more granular information. We find that two of those metrics offer different interpretations to the conclusions inferred by degree. In line with previous studies, we also find that exposure discrepancies are, among other factors, a function of in-group homophily. Lastly, we propose two intervention policies to mitigate disparate exposure effects and compare their effectiveness. We establish that, depending on the specific design, their effectiveness depends on the composition of the recommendations produced by SALSA and the fraction of minority nodes among a node's authority nodes, respectively.
